    "What is Constructor in Python?\r\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, A constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of a class. This method is defined in the class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The constructor is executed automatically at the time of object creation.\r\n",
    "The primary use of a constructor is to declare and initialize data member/ instance variables of a class. The constructor contains a collection of statements (i.e., instructions) that executes at the time of object creation to initialize the attributes of an object.\r\n",
    "For example, when we execute obj = Sample(), Python gets to know that obj is an object of class Sample and calls the constructor of that class to create an object.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Note: In Python, internally, the __new__ is the method that creates the object, and __del__ method is called to destroy the object when the reference count for that object becomes zero.\r\n",
