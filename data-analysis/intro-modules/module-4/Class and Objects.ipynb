    "What is Object Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\". The object contains both data and code: Data in the form of properties (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of methods (actions object can perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. Python programming language supports different programming approaches like functional programming, modular programming. One of the popular approaches is object-oriented programming (OOP) to solve a programming problem is by creating objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has the following two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute\n",
    "Behavior\n",
    "For example, A Car is an object, as it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "name, price, color as attributes\n",
    "breaking, acceleration as behavior\n",
    "One important aspect of OOP in Python is to create reusable code using the concept of inheritance. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Class and Objects\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object. A class is a blueprint for the object. To create an object we require a model or plan or blueprint which is nothing but class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you are creating a vehicle according to the Vehicle blueprint (template). The plan contains all dimensions and structure. Based on these descriptions, we can construct a car, truck, bus, or any vehicle. Here, a car, truck, bus are objects of Vehicle class\n",
    "\n",
    "A class contains the properties (attribute) and action (behavior) of the object. Properties represent variables, and the methods represent actions. Hence class includes both variables and methods.\n"
